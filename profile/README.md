# Welcome to TanakhCC

Welcome to TanakhCC on github!
This organization includes every single line of code and every single word of data that is part of the TanakhCC project.

TanakhCC is a volunteer project to create a pool of transcription data for the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) that is:
- **Highly accurate.** We take correctness seriously.
  All Transcriptions are read in detail by several people before their transcription gets published.
  If you find a mistake in any of our data pools, please help us out by creating an issue or pull request to fix our mistakes!
- **Digital first.**
  Data are in industry-standard formats where available to facilitate use in as many applications as possible.
  Finalized data lives in versioncontrol on github, where it is easy to correct mistakes and be transparent with the way data was entered.
  We also provide tools to work with our data.
- **Freely available.**
  Everything that TanakhCC does is MIT-0 (for the software-tools) or CC-0 (for the actual data).
  We want to provide Gods word free of charge, for anyone, forever, for any purpose, without any restrictions.

**An introduction to and explanation about TanakhCC** is available [on our website](https://tanakhcc.org).

**Work on transcriptions** happens [in our transcription tool critic](https://critic.tanakhcc.org). Also check out [the guide to TanakhCC](https://guide.tanakhcc.org/en).

**The produced transcriptions** in raw format are available in [the transcriptions repository](https://github.com/tanakhcc/transcription). You can also [check out an individual verse online](https://tanakhcc.org/read).
