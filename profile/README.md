# Welcome to TanakhCC

Welcome to TanakhCC on github!
In this repository, you will find every single line of code and every single word of data that is part of the TanakhCC project.

TanakhCC is a fully-volunteer project to create a pool of transcription data for the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) that is:
- **Highly accurate.** We take correctness seriously.
  If you find a mistake in any of our data pools, please help us out by creating an issue or pull request to fix our mistakes!
- **Digital first.**
  Data should be in industry-standard formats where available to facilitate use in as many applications as possible.
  We also provide tools to work with our data.
- **Freely available.**
  Everything that TanakhCC does is MIT-0 (for the tools) or CC-0 (for the actual data).
  We want to provide Gods word free of charge, for anyone, forever, for any purpose, without any restrictions.

## Where is...
- **An introduction to and explanation about TanakhCC** is available [on our website](https://tanakhcc.org).
- **Work on Transcriptions** happens [in our transcription tool critic](https://critic.tanakhcc.org).
    - Also check out [our guide to TanakhCC](TODO-github-pages).

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to any of TanakhCCs tools, simply create a pull request.
